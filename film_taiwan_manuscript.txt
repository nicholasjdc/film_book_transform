Note:	A rare, early English work on Taiwan and Hong Kong films screened in Taiwan during the 1960s. The text focuses on the relationship between film and Chinese society, folktales, legends, myth, opera, novels, and short-stories. The introduction’s subtitle is: “Family and Social Problems in Chinese Films Shown in Taiwan.” Includes abstracts of 329 films (pp. 41-223); film titles, presented in both Wade-Giles and Chinese characters, are followed by a synopsis and a note regarding screening locations and dates. Rather than using page numbers, the book’s general index references the text’s 329 film abstracts by their respective, sequentially assigned numbers. The quality of the book’s paper, printing, editing, translation and organization is very poor.

Li, H. C.
Chinese cinema: five bibliographies.
	Hong Kong: Studio 8, 2003.
1 v. (various pagings)
Note: 	Contains five bibliographies of English publications on Chinese cinema originally published separately in various journals: 1) “Chinese electric shadows: a selected bibliography of materials in English”, 2) “More Chinese electric shadows: a supplementary list”, 3) “Chinese electric shadows III: and the ship sails on”, 4) “Hong Kong electric shadows: a selected bibliography of studies in English”, 5) “Hong Kong electric shadows II: recent English publications on Hong Kong Cinema”. All five bibliographies are organized by format: “Books, Articles, Interviews, Literary Sources, Film Programs …”.  Taiwan cinema materials that are not specified as such under any particular category can be found in the first three bibliographies, including interesting film programs that are difficult to locate elsewhere, such as a “New Films from Taiwan” program, hosted by the American Film Institute in Washington D.C. in 1986, with an introduction by Derek Elley.
Since this is not an official publication (with no ISBN), but rather a simple combination of five separate bibliographies, there is no index in the volume. The only library that holds the book is Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Goble, Alan.
The International Film Index 1895-1990 / Edited by Alan Goble.
	London: Bowker-saur, 1991.		
2 v.
	ISBN	0862916232
Note:	Covers 182,456 films and 24,688 world film directors. Contains numerous mistakes relating to Taiwan film titles and directors’ names.
Vol. 1, “Film Titles” uses Chinese Romanized (Wade-Giles) titles as the proper titles for films produced in Taiwan, but also uses English translations of the titles as a reference. For example, Hou Hsiao-hsien's Pei-Ch’ing Cheng-Shih is used as a proper title while the English title, A City of Sadness, is provided as a reference title. Vol. 2, “Directors’ Filmography and Indexes” is categorized in four parts: 1) Directors’ filmography, 2) Directors by country, 3) Directors of animated film, and 4) Selected bibliography. 49 film directors are listed under “Taiwan” and each director’s films are listed in a corresponding filmography; for example, Hou Hsiao-hsien is presented with seven films, produced from 1983-1989, in his filmography. However, famous Taiwan director Li Xing (1930-) is listed as a Hong Kong film director, his name is misspelled “Li Hsin, 1931-”, and his limited filmography only contains works produced from 1965-1982.

	Taibei: Guo jia dian ying zi liao guan, 1999.		
312 p.
	ISBN	9579904804   
Note: 	A general English-Chinese film dictionary organized alphabetically in English. Presents general film-related terms (such as film: history, titles, directors, studios, actors and actresses, technology, theory) followed in Chinese with the term’s translation, interpretation, and historical information. Three directors of the Chinese Taipei Film Archive in Taiwan (Hsu Li-kong 1978-1989, Jing Yingrui 1989-1996, and Huang Jianye 1996-2000) spent ten years (1989-1999) completing the book. It represents the highest standard of international film studies in Taiwan. However, very few Taiwan film related subjects, such as Taiwan director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his films, are mentioned in the book, and none of the Taiwan film related subjects are treated as formal entries.

Slide, Anthony.
The international film industry: a historical dictionary.
	New York: Greenwood press, 1989.	
423 p.
	ISBN	0313256357
Note: 	This dictionary presents limited and often biased information about the Chinese film industry. For example, under the “Taiwan” entry (pp 345-346), the influence of Japan during the colonial period (1895-1945) is not mentioned, while the explanation that Taiwan’s film industry originated in mainland China is, at the least, incomplete. However, the text does provide interesting statistics regarding the overall state of the Taiwan film industry. For example, at the time of the book’s publication: 450 movie theatres were in Taiwan, the cost of producing a film in Taiwan was $100,000, and the output of Taiwan’s annual feature films decreased from 250 at the beginning of the 1980s to 150 by the end of the 1980s; also, after Japan severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in the mid-1970s, Japanese films were banned in Taiwan. Includes an index at the end of the book and a bibliography under each entry.

However, the coverage of Taiwan film and television is incomplete and misleading due to the fact that its editorial board and contributors does not include recognized Taiwan film and television experts.

Note: 	A biographical dictionary of more than 1,100 Chinese film actors and actresses in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Organized by the number of Chinese character strokes in the names. The editor admits, in the preface, that many Taiwan and Hong Kong film actors and actresses are not included due to limited contact with Taiwan's film industry. Interestingly, Taiwan film actress Jiang Qing (1946- ) is included in the book; however, the mainland China film actress Jiang Qing (1914-1991) is not included in the book because, as Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong’s wife, her later political involvement led the editor to decide not to include her in the book. Includes a name index based on the number of Chinese character strokes in each name, a name index based on Pinyin names in alphabetical order at the beginning of the book, two lists of mainland China and Taiwan film actors and actresses who won awards abroad, and three lists of film actors and actresses who won any of the three domestic film awards in both mainland China and Taiwan.

Palmer, Bill, 1947-
The encyclopedia of martial arts movies / Bill Palmer, Karen Palmer, and Ric Meyers.
	Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995.	
465 p.
	ISBN	0810830272 (acid-free paper)
Note: 	Provides 3,281 entries on martial arts films produced mainly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and China with film information including the title, cast, director, producer, film studio, runtime, and availability. The major problems with the text are as follows: only English translations are used for all non-English films, and the names of Chinese cast members are often romanized in nonstandard ways. For example, famous Chinese martial arts film star Jet Li is presented as “Li Lianjie,” which is the standard Pinyin romanization system of his name, or “Li Lien-chieh,” his name in the standard Wade-Giles Romanization system. However, Jet Li’s name, in this work, is: “Li Lin-jei.” Jet Li’s popular, non-standard English name, “Jat Lee,” is provided in the Aliases section. Includes bibliographical references (p. 417), aliases, and a name index.

	ISBN	7106000914
	Note:	The revised edition of the same book published in 1988.
The preface reveals that the author started his research on Taiwan films in 1980 in the first academic research institution of its kind in mainland China, the Taiwan Research Center of Xiamen University.  After the first edition of the book was published in 1988, the author was able to visit Taiwan several times in order to locate additional academic research materials and meet with Taiwan film colleagues and counterparts. This lead to significant changes and additions in this revised edition. The beginning period of Taiwan film history under the Japanese rule starts in 1896 instead of 1895; Taiwanese-dialect film period ends in 1972 instead of 1962; and the golden age of Taiwan film starts in 1960 instead of 1963.  Chapter 7: Taiwan New Cinema (1982-1987), Chapter 8: Taiwan Film since 1990 (1990-2004), and Chapter 9: New generation of Taiwan film directors and their film arts (1987-2004) are all new additions to the book.

			風雲電影系列
Note:	A comprehensive work on Chinese martial arts film history. Divides the development of Chinese martial arts films into five periods: 1) the first period in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, 2) a shift to Hong Kong in the 1940s and 1950s, 3) Hong Kong, and later in Taiwan, in the 1960s and 1970s, 4) a cooperative period between Hong Kong and mainland China in the 1980s and 1990s, and 5) the trend towards globalization and further cooperation between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, using Ang Lee’s film Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (2000) as an example. 
	In the postscript, the author admits that his knowledge of Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts films, specifically during the mid-1960s to the early- 1980s period, is limited and thus apologizes for any missing or over- simplified parts during this section of the book.

	Taipei: Zhonghua ying ping ren xie hui, 2004.	
2 v.
Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.
Includes some bibliographic information at the end of selected chapters.

Note:	This essential book studies Taiwan film history from political, economic, and aesthetic perspectives. Taiwan film history is divided into the following time periods: 1949, 1950-1954, 1955-1959, 1960-1964, 1965-1969, 1970-1974, 1975-1979, 1980-1984, 1985-1989, and 1990-1994.

Taiwan dian ying xi ju shi = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
台灣電影戲劇史 = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
	Taibei: Yin hua chu ban she, 1961.	
577 p.
Note:	This is the earliest known academic work on Taiwan film and opera/drama history written by a Taiwanese scholar. The first part of the book, Taiwan Film History (pp. 1-156), contains Chapter 1: Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period, Chapter 2: Taiwan Film after retrocession, Chapter 3: International cooperation in film production, Chapter 4: Introduction of Taiwan film studios, Chapter 5: Official film advisory and censorship functions, Chapter 6: Non-governmental film organizations, Chapter 7: Film education and workshops, Chapter 8: Film related publications, Chapter 9: Film theory and critics, and Chapter 10: Film industry and theatres. 
   	As a groundbreaking work, the author provides a vast amount of firsthand information about Taiwan Film History from 1901-1961, including dates, names, and events related to the Taiwan film. However, as an academic work, it is weak in terms of theoretical analysis and objectivity due to the limits of the overall political and academic environment during the time. 
Moreover, in 1992, Lee Daw-ming, a Taiwan scholar, found out that Lu had copied part of chapter 3 from Japanese scholar Sai Ichigawa’s work: Ajia eiga no sōzō oyobi kensetsu (Creation and Building of Asian Films) in Chapter 1: “Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period” within the Taiwan Film History part of his work. Li’s discovery was published in the article: “Dian ying shi ru he lai dao Taiwan de” (How did film come to Taiwan), in Dian ying xin shang (Film Appreciation), No. 9/10, (Sept. /Oct., 1993) p. 107.
The preface includes an introduction of the author written by You Mijian.
Appendix includes the author’s photo collection (pp. 536-542), an essay on Taiwanese-dialect film (pp. 543-544), and the author’s resume (pp. 576).

Note:  	An early collection of scholarly work on Chinese cinema.

The essay “The distinct Taiwanese and Hong Kong cinemas” by Chiao Hsiung-Ping provides a comparative study of Taiwan and Hong Kong cinema from a historical perspective.

Note:	This is an unprecedented joint project involving scholars from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China under the auspices of the Chinese Taipei Film Archive. It presents short essays, chronological statements, quoted film reviews, and a prodigious quantity of film stills, posters, and photos to illustrate a century of Chinese cinema history. It is the most objective and comprehensive description of Chinese film history in terms of the photographic materials and range of subjects included in the book, but not in terms of in-depth academic exploration of the topics presented.  
	It is a bilingual work of Chinese and English and is divided into four parts:  Chinese Cinema 1896-1949 (with separate chapters dealing with the beginnings of Chinese cinema in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Taiwan Cinema 1949-1999, Hong Kong Cinema 1949-1999, and Mainland Chinese Cinema 1949-1999.
	The text attempts to tackle controversial issues, such as the Japanese influence on cinema during the colonial period, government censorship in Taiwan, anti-communist propaganda films, and the February 28th Incident in 1947 in Taiwan. A comparative line of study connects Taiwan (and Japan during the colonial period), Hong Kong, and mainland China throughout the book. 
Unfortunately, apart from a short bibliography, there is no index for the incredibly rich film related materials, particularly the photographical materials, from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.

			影，响丛书
Note:	Presents Taiwan film history from 1973-2004. Chapter 1 focuses on Qiong Yao’s literary and melodramatic films during the 1970s, Chapter 2 deals with the Taiwan native (xiang tu) films represented by Li Xing and his films during the 1970s and 1980s, Chapter 3 describes Taiwan student films represented by Lin Qingjie, Ouyang Jun, and others, Chapter 4 comments on the unsuccessful development of kung fu film by Hong Kong film director King Hu, Chapter 5 and 6 describe the arrival of the Taiwan New Cinema represented by Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Wang Tung, and others during the 1980s, Chapter 7 laments Taiwan cinema’s decline in the 1990s, and Chapter 8 concludes with a description of the struggling Taiwan film industry at the beginning of the 2000s. 
The book reads more as a personal commentary and introduction to Taiwan film history for a general audience than as a serious academic work. Some arguments within the book are questionable, such as the author’s claim that kung fu film development in Taiwan was unsuccessful; in fact, Taiwan Kung Fu film production, initiated by King Hu and his film Longmen Ke Zhan (Dragon Gate Inn) 1967 was very successful in Taiwan. Based on statistics, during the first quarter of 1968, eight Taiwan kung fu films earned a box office income of more than 1 million Taiwan dollars. Not to mention, Taiwan film director Ang Lee’s kung fu film: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) was also successful, winning various film awards throughout the world, including four Academy Awards. On the other hand, the author has devoted a complete chapter to discuss Taiwan student films, a topic that is not often the focus Taiwan film analyses.
Includes a list of Golden Horse Award winning films and a Taiwan film chronology from 1973-2004, but there is neither a bibliography nor index.

Vol. 2: “Hegemony and the aesthetic of Taiwan documentary film in the early post-Martial Law era”, curated by Lin Bao-yuan, reviews challenges to the hegemony and the aesthetic development of documentary films from 1985-1999 (Martial Law was lifted in 1987).

Vol. 5: “History, memory, representation and documentary film”, curated by Lee Daw-ming, investigates the aesthetic strategy of Taiwan documentary films in reconstructing Taiwan history, which is to combine the “big history” of influential historical figures and the “small history” made up of ordinary people.

Yang, Jeff.
Once upon a time in China: a guide to Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese cinema / Jeff Yang; senior contributor, Art Black, John Charles ….. [et al.]
	New York: Artria books, 2003.	
306 p.
	ISBN	0743448170
Note:	This is a unique and comparative, but Hong Kong-centric, guide to film production in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland. It endeavors to locate common themes between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland Chinese films within each chapter for each time period and explore their “intertwined traditions.” Chapters are as follows:
	Chapter 1: The Dawn of Chinese Film: 1896-1949
	Chapter 2: Swordsmen and Revolutionaries: The Fifties and Sixties
	Chapter 3: Martial Arts and Melodrama: The Seventies
	Chapter 4: New Wave Dreams and Ballistic Kisses: The Eighties
	Chapter 5: The Best of Times, the Worst of Times: The Nineties
	Epilogue: 2000 and Beyond
	All chapters include Capsule Reviews.
	Except for chapter one, which focuses on Mainland China films, all of the following chapters are dominated by Hong Kong films. Attention to Taiwan film is certainly the weakest in the book; for example, there is no mention of Taiwan film production in Chapter 1; and in Chapter 2, while nine Hong Kong film directors and their films are mentioned, only three Taiwan film directors and films are mentioned, and one of them is King Hu whose film career took him from Hong Kong to Taiwan and then back to Hong Kong again. Also note, the text’s method of only using English translations for the titles of all Chinese films could cause confusion. 
	Overall, this text can not be considered a comprehensive guide for films in all three areas, as the main author points out in the preface. 
	Includes Capsule Film Reviews for all chapters, but note that there are some mistakes; for example, the capsule review for Chapter 2 labels two King Hu movies as mainland China productions.   
Includes bibliography (as Notes) and index.

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

	Series title:	National Cinemas
Note:	A serious academic work that provides thorough research and original perspectives. As the first attempt to outline Chinese film history in English with an up-to-date and “chronological history” study approach, the author uses a “Chinese national cinema” paradigm to cover all films produced in mainland China (including those prior to 1949), Hong Kong and Taiwan, while at the same time instructing the reader to keep in mind all associated problematics and “messiness” -- theoretical as well as geopolitical -- surrounding “China” and “Chineseness”. Th text forms a “general and potentially comparative framework of Chinese national cinema” in the three territories of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Unlike many other works on the same subject, it provides a unique historical perspective: “Cinema and national traditions, 1896-1929”, “Cinema and the nation-people, 1930-49”,  “Cinematic reinvention of the national in Taiwan, 1896-1978”,  “Cinematic revival of the regional in Hong Kong, 1945-78”, “Cinema and the nation-state in the PRC, 1949-78”, “Cinema and national/regional cultures, 1979-89”,  “Cinema and the transnational imaginary, 1990-2002”.  This is not a comprehensive history of Chinese cinema; the author states: “this book concentrates primarily on feature films”.
	Since the publisher does not print Chinese characters, the author reasonably used Pinyin unless names are more commonly recognized in Wade-Giles or Cantonese (for more information regarding this tactic, see the “Romanization and Name spelling” section at the beginning of this volume). Almost all Chinese film titles in the text and index are presented in their English translations, without romanization or Chinese characters.

170 p.
Note: 	As the author states in the preface, this work focuses its attention on film policy issues in Taiwan from 1949-1967. The book provides suggestions to the government regarding the establishment of complete and reasonable film laws and policies that would enable the best possible environment for the development of Taiwan's film industry. For example, the author recommends controlling the importation and distribution of foreign films in Taiwan due to the threat of American film distribution in Taiwan.  Suggestions are also made regarding Taiwan's filmmaking personnel by offering a comparative study of Japanese and Taiwan film development after WWII. The Appendix includes some important statistics, such as a filmography of Taiwan films produced from 1948-1967 (pp. 77-87), the annual ten best Mandarin films at the box office from 1957-1967 (pp. 78-96), and a statistical record of movie theatre attendance in the Taiwan area in 1967 (pp. 97-98).

Note: 	A general introduction to Chinese film history from 1911-1961. Chapter 1 deals with Chinese film history in mainland China before 1937; Chapter 2 describes the development of the Chinese film industry during and after the Sino-Japanese War, 1937-1949, including the film industry in Hong Kong and Taiwan after the war; and Chapter 3 introduces the current (1965) situation of the film industry and production in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The book presents the official views of the Nationalist Government controlled by the KMT (Kuomintang Party); thus, it is critical of the Left-wing Movement of Chinese films during the 1930s and 1940s, pinpoints two films produced during the war: Wan shi liu fang and Chun jiang yi hen as products of co-operation with the Japanese, it does not mention the Japanese influence on the Taiwan film industry, and it ignores the strict government censorship of film in Taiwan after the Nationalist Government fled to Taiwan in 1949.

Note:	An oral history of the Guomin Xi Yuan movie theater and film history in Hsinchu city, Taiwan. The work consists of two parts: “Historical records from the people’s perspective” and “Guomin theatres and the history of Hsinchu film industry development”. In 1933, the Japanese colonial government built Taiwan’s first theatre with airconditioning, Youle Guan, in Hsinchu, which was re-named Guomin Da Xi Yuan after Taiwan retrocession in 1945 and then closed in 1991. In 2000, the Hsinchu Image Museum opened in the original Guomin Xi Yuan location. Memories from the local community, film directors, artists, theater staff and managers regarding Guomin Xi Yuan provide a unique perspective on the film history of Hsinchu.

The paper studies the cultural nature of the Kaohsiung Municipal Film Archive and analyzes the staff working in the Archive by using: participant observation, in-depth interviews, and qualitative research.
The paper concludes that the staff of the archive identified with the formation and organization of the film archive, but did not identify with Taiwan film culture. The paper recommends that the government: clearly identify its position in relation to the cultural nature of Taiwan’s film industry, create a single and united department in charge of planning and managing film related affairs, and employ a contract-based recruiting system for hiring the archive’s film professionals.

By using three films as case studies, the author explains how1990s films appear to no longer compare urban settings with rural settings or contrast modern culture with traditional culture; rather, 1990s Taiwan films present the city in a more direct way as they record Taipei city’s social and cultural transformation.

The paper studies how Taiwan’s film industry was managed during the political struggle between Taiwan Governor Chen Yi and the KMT CC Clique after retrocession from 1945-1949. The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.

Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 1991. An exploration of the rise and fall of Taiwanese-dialect cinema from 1955-1981. Describes the economic conditions and competition of Taiwanese-dialect films, and government film policies. In conclusion, the paper states that the following reasons lead to the eventual downturn of Taiwanese-dialect cinema: 1. Initially local filmmakers in Taiwan started to produce Taiwanese-dialect films due to a weak market of Mandarin films and stimulation of popular Xiamen-dialect films, 2. the quality of early Taiwanese-dialect films was poor and did not improve over time, even after its initial popular period, due to limited resources, 3. Taiwanese-dialect films inevitably lost their share of the market share when the Mandarin film industry emerged and Japanese films were banned, 4. government film policy and officials in Taiwan were always hostile to Taiwanese-dialect films and film-making. Includes Chinese Abstract, Bibliography, Chronology of Domestic Political Affairs, Film Policies and Government-owned Film Studios, Charts of Mandarin Film-Making and Taiwanese-Dialect Filmmaking, Filmography of Mandarin Films 1949-1954, Taiwanese Theatrical Professionals Involved in Taiwanese-dialect Filmmaking, Lists of Taiwanese-dialect and Mandarin Films Selected and Received Golden Horse Awards, Production Charts of Mandarin and Taiwanese-dialect Films from 1955-1974, and Box Office Record of 1965.

Note:	According to the author’s preface and introduction to this Taiwanese-dialect film history, the title of the book should have been: Authentic History of Taiwanese-dialect Film; however, no explanation is provided to account for the change in title. Ye used Huang Ren’s 1994 work as a reference, yet integrates new perspectives, including the political, sociological and cultural; due to the author’s academic background, the text provides a scholarly approach to Taiwanese-dialect film history in contrast to Huang Ren’s work published earlier. The author suggests that the Taiwanese-dialect film movement lasted from 1955-1974, althrough there were a few attemps to revive its seemingly inevitable death from 1974-1981, while Huang Ren claims the movement ended in 1980. The filmography includes Taiwanese-dialect films produced from 1955-1981 and includes films not listed in Huang Ren’s work. Ye is critical of the KMT’s handling of the 2/28 Incident and the KMT government’s policy vis-à-vis Taiwanese-dialect film. Contains seven chapters with notes for each chapter.

The paper analyzes the discursive formation of Taiwan’s Healthy Realism movement in the 1960s. The author argues that, based on an understanding of the historical milieu, including KMT film and cultural policy practiced since the 1930s and widespread government censorship in Taiwan during the 1960s, while at the same time filmmakers used subtle tactics in their struggle for artistic freedom and film critics and film historians desired relevant film productions while preserving the KMT’s monolithic governance, Healthy Realism emerged as a landmark achievement, exerting a powerful influence on popular memory and social integration.

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

In terms of differences, mainland Chinese films did not participate in the Taipei Film Awards, notably this occurred when pro-independence R.O.C. President Chen Shuibian was in office -- interestingly, he provides the preface of the book -- and the final Film Catalog includes only Taiwan and Hong Kong films.

Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – Tamkang University, 2007.
Analyzes four coming-of-age films produced in the 1980s that represent teenagers growing up on campuses. Identifies the ways teenagers become socialized and gradually conform to the masculine stereotypes expected of them as they are raised by authoritative male figures within a patriarchal society. The comradery forged among the male teenagers arguably represents the comradery among citizens of the nation as a whole within the national imaginary.

Discusses five Taiwan films that represent mother-daughter relationships in Taiwan films during the 1980s and 1990s in order to investigate cinematic reflections of patriarchal attitudes by using feminist criticism, motherhood theory, visual aesthetics and intertextuality. The paper concludes that in Taiwan films of 1980s, mothers performed a traditional role in the family while their daughters learned to become independent, while films of the 1990s films focused on “Maternal Sexuality” and “Lesbian Sexuality” and placed “subjectivity” as the priority for female identity.

Inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s notion of the time-image, the paper re-defines the three signature styles of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: Nostalgia, Slowness, and Realism through a new concept: “Train-image”. The train is not simply regarded as a diegetic symbol in his films, but instead a metaphor combining train-traveling and film-viewing experience to recapitulate the aesthetics of Hou’s films.

The author emphasizes the uniqueness of Hou and his films, which redefine the meaning of national cinema with the environment of globalization, nativism, state-sponsored cultural identity, and regionally differentiated identity.

Identifies emergent cultural forces in Taiwan by analyzing representations of the “foreign” or “foreigner” in films of the 1980s. Subjects include: filmmakers Edward Yang, Chang Yi, and Hou Hsiao-hsien, as well as filmmaker and playwright Stan Lai. The author analyzes the setting of Taipei in Edward Yang’s films, explores Stan Lai’s works dealing with the condition of mainlanders in Taiwan, considers the representation and cultural meanings inherent to Yang Huishan’s body in three films made by Chang Yi, and presents Hou Hsiao-hsien as the most daring experimenter, a director who pursues a foreign narrative form to tell stories about Taiwan on the silver screen.

Note:	A collection of essays critical of Taiwan New Cinema director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his acclaimed film A City of Sadness (1989). Several essays declare that the death of Taiwan New Cinema occurred in 1988 when Hou Hsiao-hsien and other Taiwan New Cinema directors delivered a “Taiwan Film Memoratum” in 1987 and then agreed to make the government policy film Everything for the Events of Tomorrow for the Taiwan’s Defense Department in 1988. Most of the film reviews of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film A City of Sadness (1989) take both a negative view of the director’s portrayal of the 2/28 Incident and the film as a whole. Also includes a negative review of Taiwan’s so-called first independently made film, The Man From the Island West (1990).

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Chung Cheng University, 2008. 
Asserts that Hou Hsiao-hsien’s unconventional style in his film A City of Sadness (1989) should be examined carefully, for the director’s representation of history reveals an indirect cinematic, but not an evasive, approach to the historical reality. This position is voiced in contradition to critics who claim Hou's representation of the 2/28 Incident keeps a safe distance from the sensitive events and conforms to the KMT government's perspective. It is written in English.

Note:	A collection of essays critical of Taiwan New Cinema director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his acclaimed film A City of Sadness (1989). Several essays declare that the death of Taiwan New Cinema occurred in 1988 when Hou Hsiao-hsien and other Taiwan New Cinema directors delivered a “Taiwan Film Memoratum” in 1987 and then agreed to make the government policy film Everything for the Events of Tomorrow for the Taiwan’s Defense Department in 1988. Most of the film reviews of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film A City of Sadness (1989) take both a negative view of the director’s portrayal of the 2/28 Incident and the film as a whole. Also includes a negative review of Taiwan’s so-called first independently made film, The Man From the Island West (1990).

Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

台灣電影百年史話/黃仁,王唯編著.
	Taipei: Zhonghua ying ping ren xie hui, 2004.	
2 v.
Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.
Includes some bibliographic information at the end of selected chapters.

Note:	This study is the result of a project entitled the “Taiwan Documentary Aesthetic Series,” hosted by the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in 2008. Examines multiple topics while providing the history of Taiwan documentary films in a systematic way. Five Taiwan documentary film studies scholars were invited to act as curators for the project, and each scholar presents his/her perspective on the development of Taiwan documentary film aesthetics in this work. 
Vol. 1: “A pre-history of Taiwanese documentary filmmaking: actualities, home movies and documentary”, curated by Liao Gene-fon, covers early documentary films from the 1930s to the 1970s.
Vol. 2: “Hegemony and the aesthetic of Taiwan documentary film in the early post-Martial Law era”, curated by Lin Bao-yuan, reviews challenges to the hegemony and the aesthetic development of documentary films from 1985-1999 (Martial Law was lifted in 1987).
Vol. 3: “Private me time: I and my …”, curated by Wen Tien-hsiang, describes the arrival of “Private me time” in Taiwan documentary films from 1990-2008.
Vol. 4: “Video-dialogue with one self in the aesthetics of documentary films: between truth and fiction, between documentary and drama”, curated by Wang Wei-tsy, considers female perspectives in Taiwan documentary films and deals with female expressions through the documentary form
Vol. 5: “History, memory, representation and documentary film”, curated by Lee Daw-ming, investigates the aesthetic strategy of Taiwan documentary films in reconstructing Taiwan history, which is to combine the “big history” of influential historical figures and the “small history” made up of ordinary people.
Includes both Chinese and English versions of the curator’s essays, a film list, and records of the panel discussions.

This genre of film arrived while Taiwan’s film industry was at a low ebb. The success of this series reveals a grassroots force that is leading the rebound of the Taiwan film industry.

Note: 	A major work on Chinese martial arts films by mainland Chinese film  scholar Chen Mo. However, according to the author’s postscript, the author could only access martial arts films located in the Chinese Film Archive in Beijing, but not those in Hong Kong or the Chinese Taipei Film Archive in Taipei when he was writing the book; thus, the Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts film sections in the book can not be seen as comprehensive. There is no explanation for the interruption of martial arts film development in mainland China after 1949. Another missing aspect of the book is the absence of a Chinese martial arts filmography.

Note:	A comprehensive work on Chinese martial arts film history. Divides the development of Chinese martial arts films into five periods: 1) the first period in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, 2) a shift to Hong Kong in the 1940s and 1950s, 3) Hong Kong, and later in Taiwan, in the 1960s and 1970s, 4) a cooperative period between Hong Kong and mainland China in the 1980s and 1990s, and 5) the trend towards globalization and further cooperation between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, using Ang Lee’s film Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (2000) as an example. 
	In the postscript, the author admits that his knowledge of Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts films, specifically during the mid-1960s to the early- 1980s period, is limited and thus apologizes for any missing or over- simplified parts during this section of the book.

Note:	An early attempt by the mainland China scholar to explore common themes within martial arts films produced in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, the  book can not be viewed as a serious academic work due to the fact that the author did not have direct access to resources in Taiwan, such as the resources at the Chinese Taipei Film Archive, and thus did not attain a sufficient quantity of reliable primary sources to support his assertions.
Includes a filmography of the famous Chinese martial arts figure Huang Feihong (Wong Fei-Hung) from 1949-1994, but there is no bibliography.

Note: 	Provides 3,281 entries on martial arts films produced mainly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and China with film information including the title, cast, director, producer, film studio, runtime, and availability. The major problems with the text are as follows: only English translations are used for all non-English films, and the names of Chinese cast members are often romanized in nonstandard ways. For example, famous Chinese martial arts film star Jet Li is presented as “Li Lianjie,” which is the standard Pinyin romanization system of his name, or “Li Lien-chieh,” his name in the standard Wade-Giles Romanization system. However, Jet Li’s name, in this work, is: “Li Lin-jei.” Jet Li’s popular, non-standard English name, “Jat Lee,” is provided in the Aliases section. Includes bibliographical references (p. 417), aliases, and a name index.

Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 1991. An exploration of the rise and fall of Taiwanese-dialect cinema from 1955-1981. Describes the economic conditions and competition of Taiwanese-dialect films, and government film policies. In conclusion, the paper states that the following reasons lead to the eventual downturn of Taiwanese-dialect cinema: 1. Initially local filmmakers in Taiwan started to produce Taiwanese-dialect films due to a weak market of Mandarin films and stimulation of popular Xiamen-dialect films, 2. the quality of early Taiwanese-dialect films was poor and did not improve over time, even after its initial popular period, due to limited resources, 3. Taiwanese-dialect films inevitably lost their share of the market share when the Mandarin film industry emerged and Japanese films were banned, 4. government film policy and officials in Taiwan were always hostile to Taiwanese-dialect films and film-making. Includes Chinese Abstract, Bibliography, Chronology of Domestic Political Affairs, Film Policies and Government-owned Film Studios, Charts of Mandarin Film-Making and Taiwanese-Dialect Filmmaking, Filmography of Mandarin Films 1949-1954, Taiwanese Theatrical Professionals Involved in Taiwanese-dialect Filmmaking, Lists of Taiwanese-dialect and Mandarin Films Selected and Received Golden Horse Awards, Production Charts of Mandarin and Taiwanese-dialect Films from 1955-1974, and Box Office Record of 1965.

台灣電影戲劇史 = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
	Taibei: Yin hua chu ban she, 1961.	
577 p.
Note:	This is the earliest known academic work on Taiwan film and opera/drama history written by a Taiwanese scholar. The first part of the book, Taiwan Film History (pp. 1-156), contains Chapter 1: Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period, Chapter 2: Taiwan Film after retrocession, Chapter 3: International cooperation in film production, Chapter 4: Introduction of Taiwan film studios, Chapter 5: Official film advisory and censorship functions, Chapter 6: Non-governmental film organizations, Chapter 7: Film education and workshops, Chapter 8: Film related publications, Chapter 9: Film theory and critics, and Chapter 10: Film industry and theatres. 
   	As a groundbreaking work, the author provides a vast amount of firsthand information about Taiwan Film History from 1901-1961, including dates, names, and events related to the Taiwan film. However, as an academic work, it is weak in terms of theoretical analysis and objectivity due to the limits of the overall political and academic environment during the time. 
Moreover, in 1992, Lee Daw-ming, a Taiwan scholar, found out that Lu had copied part of chapter 3 from Japanese scholar Sai Ichigawa’s work: Ajia eiga no sōzō oyobi kensetsu (Creation and Building of Asian Films) in Chapter 1: “Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period” within the Taiwan Film History part of his work. Li’s discovery was published in the article: “Dian ying shi ru he lai dao Taiwan de” (How did film come to Taiwan), in Dian ying xin shang (Film Appreciation), No. 9/10, (Sept. /Oct., 1993) p. 107.
The preface includes an introduction of the author written by You Mijian.
Appendix includes the author’s photo collection (pp. 536-542), an essay on Taiwanese-dialect film (pp. 543-544), and the author’s resume (pp. 576).

A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.
Includes a filmography (leaves. 243-247) and bibliography (leaves. 248-263)

	211 p.
	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 2006.
Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

Asserts that Hou Hsiao-hsien’s unconventional style in his film A City of Sadness (1989) should be examined carefully, for the director’s representation of history reveals an indirect cinematic, but not an evasive, approach to the historical reality. This position is voiced in contradition to critics who claim Hou's representation of the 2/28 Incident keeps a safe distance from the sensitive events and conforms to the KMT government's perspective. It is written in English.

Note:	A collection of essays critical of Taiwan New Cinema director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his acclaimed film A City of Sadness (1989). Several essays declare that the death of Taiwan New Cinema occurred in 1988 when Hou Hsiao-hsien and other Taiwan New Cinema directors delivered a “Taiwan Film Memoratum” in 1987 and then agreed to make the government policy film Everything for the Events of Tomorrow for the Taiwan’s Defense Department in 1988. Most of the film reviews of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film A City of Sadness (1989) take both a negative view of the director’s portrayal of the 2/28 Incident and the film as a whole. Also includes a negative review of Taiwan’s so-called first independently made film, The Man From the Island West (1990).

	173 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Chiao Tung University, 2004.
Explores the new model of international film production in Taiwan used by Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia (CPFPA) to produce and release the mystery thriller Double Vision (2002), which was successful at the box office in Taiwan after CPFPA had already been successful with its product Crouching tiger, hidden dragon. This model represents a trend of cultural globalization and commodification in Taiwan film production. Appling the discourse of the New International Division of Cultural Labor (NIDCL) and the Global Film Market System in the case of Double Vision, the close connection between transnational film production and characteristics of Hollywood film production is evident. Concludes that the existence of high quality international film co-productions brings major challenges to Taiwan film production in the 21st century due to their emphasis on commercial success rather than cultural representation.  
Includes Chinese & English abstract, Bibliography, and Structure Charts of the globalization of Taiwan film production and information on four films by CPFPA since 2000.

Note:	A collection of essays critical of Taiwan New Cinema director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his acclaimed film A City of Sadness (1989). Several essays declare that the death of Taiwan New Cinema occurred in 1988 when Hou Hsiao-hsien and other Taiwan New Cinema directors delivered a “Taiwan Film Memoratum” in 1987 and then agreed to make the government policy film Everything for the Events of Tomorrow for the Taiwan’s Defense Department in 1988. Most of the film reviews of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film A City of Sadness (1989) take both a negative view of the director’s portrayal of the 2/28 Incident and the film as a whole. Also includes a negative review of Taiwan’s so-called first independently made film, The Man From the Island West (1990).

Note:	This study is the result of a project entitled the “Taiwan Documentary Aesthetic Series,” hosted by the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in 2008. Examines multiple topics while providing the history of Taiwan documentary films in a systematic way. Five Taiwan documentary film studies scholars were invited to act as curators for the project, and each scholar presents his/her perspective on the development of Taiwan documentary film aesthetics in this work. 
Vol. 1: “A pre-history of Taiwanese documentary filmmaking: actualities, home movies and documentary”, curated by Liao Gene-fon, covers early documentary films from the 1930s to the 1970s.
Vol. 2: “Hegemony and the aesthetic of Taiwan documentary film in the early post-Martial Law era”, curated by Lin Bao-yuan, reviews challenges to the hegemony and the aesthetic development of documentary films from 1985-1999 (Martial Law was lifted in 1987).
Vol. 3: “Private me time: I and my …”, curated by Wen Tien-hsiang, describes the arrival of “Private me time” in Taiwan documentary films from 1990-2008.
Vol. 4: “Video-dialogue with one self in the aesthetics of documentary films: between truth and fiction, between documentary and drama”, curated by Wang Wei-tsy, considers female perspectives in Taiwan documentary films and deals with female expressions through the documentary form
Vol. 5: “History, memory, representation and documentary film”, curated by Lee Daw-ming, investigates the aesthetic strategy of Taiwan documentary films in reconstructing Taiwan history, which is to combine the “big history” of influential historical figures and the “small history” made up of ordinary people.
Includes both Chinese and English versions of the curator’s essays, a film list, and records of the panel discussions.

	Note:	Thesis (Ph.D.) – Fu Jen Catholic University, 2008.
The paper analyzes the discursive formation of Taiwan’s Healthy Realism movement in the 1960s. The author argues that, based on an understanding of the historical milieu, including KMT film and cultural policy practiced since the 1930s and widespread government censorship in Taiwan during the 1960s, while at the same time filmmakers used subtle tactics in their struggle for artistic freedom and film critics and film historians desired relevant film productions while preserving the KMT’s monolithic governance, Healthy Realism emerged as a landmark achievement, exerting a powerful influence on popular memory and social integration.

A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

Inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s notion of the time-image, the paper re-defines the three signature styles of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: Nostalgia, Slowness, and Realism through a new concept: “Train-image”. The train is not simply regarded as a diegetic symbol in his films, but instead a metaphor combining train-traveling and film-viewing experience to recapitulate the aesthetics of Hou’s films.

Note:	A collection of essays critical of Taiwan New Cinema director Hou Hsiao-hsien and his acclaimed film A City of Sadness (1989). Several essays declare that the death of Taiwan New Cinema occurred in 1988 when Hou Hsiao-hsien and other Taiwan New Cinema directors delivered a “Taiwan Film Memoratum” in 1987 and then agreed to make the government policy film Everything for the Events of Tomorrow for the Taiwan’s Defense Department in 1988. Most of the film reviews of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film A City of Sadness (1989) take both a negative view of the director’s portrayal of the 2/28 Incident and the film as a whole. Also includes a negative review of Taiwan’s so-called first independently made film, The Man From the Island West (1990).

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

Note:	A comprehensive work on Chinese martial arts film history. Divides the development of Chinese martial arts films into five periods: 1) the first period in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, 2) a shift to Hong Kong in the 1940s and 1950s, 3) Hong Kong, and later in Taiwan, in the 1960s and 1970s, 4) a cooperative period between Hong Kong and mainland China in the 1980s and 1990s, and 5) the trend towards globalization and further cooperation between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, using Ang Lee’s film Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (2000) as an example. 
	In the postscript, the author admits that his knowledge of Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts films, specifically during the mid-1960s to the early- 1980s period, is limited and thus apologizes for any missing or over- simplified parts during this section of the book.

Curtin, Michael.
Playing to the world’s biggest audience: the globalization of Chinese film and TV.

341 p.
	ISBN	9780520251335 (cloth: alk.paper) 9780520251342 (pbk.: alk.paper)
Note:	Michael Curtin’s text, Playing to the World’s Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV examines the shifting dynamics of film and television industries in an era of global connectivity.  While the historical breadth of the project considers the early filmic entertainment industries in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it focuses on the: “dramatic changes that have occurred since the 1980s with the end of the Cold War, the rise of the World Trade Organization, the modernization policies of the PRC, the end of martial law in Taiwan, the transfer off Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the high-tech liberalization of Singapore, the rise of consumer and youth cultures across the regions, and the growing wealth and influence of overseas Chinese in such cities as Vancouver, London, and Kuala Lumpur” (3). This book focuses on the challenge of globalization during the 1990s and early 2000s, confronts the idea that Hollywood hegemony will last indefinitely, and considers globalized Chinese media enterprises that faced a slower pace of expansion in wake of the financial crisis of 1997 and the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000.  In short, the text discusses how commercial media enterprises -- and at times the text addresses state media in the PRC -- adjusts and shifts to the social and institutional dynamics of the new millennium. Includes a broad historical synopsis of the Shaw Brothers Studio (Chapter 1), a study of Hollywood’s saturation of Taiwan’s film market (Chapter 4), and an account of the current cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan (Chapter 6). 
Includes Industry Interviews, Notes, Bibliography, and Index.

Note:	Introduces the 1997 Taibei Film Award (臺北電影獎, the forerunner to the Taipei Film Festival), with the same series title as the 1994 publication.
	However, the text differs from the 1994 publication in interesting ways. In terms of additions, Taiwan and Hong Kong film scholars report on the films from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China, review important films from 1995-1997, and introduce five contemporary Taiwan and Hong Kong directors. In terms of differences, mainland Chinese films did not participate in the Taipei Film Awards, notably this occurred when pro-independence R.O.C. President Chen Shuibian was in office -- interestingly, he provides the preface of the book -- and the final Film Catalog includes only Taiwan and Hong Kong films.

Rather than using page numbers, the book’s general index references the text’s 329 film abstracts by their respective, sequentially assigned numbers. The quality of the book’s paper, printing, editing, translation and organization is very poor.

2 v.
Note:	A comprehensive and objective work on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovered that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple, different perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters.   
Shortcomings of the work include: 1) Poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) Poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of some chapters. Thus, it is difficult to treat this text as a reference tool, even though it presents many important historical materials.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 2006.
Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

Analyzes the “2009 Busha Asia Film Market Exhibition” and the “2010 Hong Kong Filmart” in order to explore international distribution strategies for Taiwan cinema. Concludes the following: Taiwan films should first be distributed to Chinese and Asian markes, current Taiwan cinema style and content is not particularly appealing to audiences overseas, limiting investor interest, and the quality of Taiwan’s art films must improve in order to compete in the competitive international marketplace. Finally, the author recommends that if Taiwan filmmakers want to enter the international market then they should select topics and scripts that match concurrent world cinema trends.

Note:	This is an unprecedented joint project involving scholars from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China under the auspices of the Chinese Taipei Film Archive. It presents short essays, chronological statements, quoted film reviews, and a prodigious quantity of film stills, posters, and photos to illustrate a century of Chinese cinema history. It is the most objective and comprehensive description of Chinese film history in terms of the photographic materials and range of subjects included in the book, but not in terms of in-depth academic exploration of the topics presented.  
	It is a bilingual work of Chinese and English and is divided into four parts:  Chinese Cinema 1896-1949 (with separate chapters dealing with the beginnings of Chinese cinema in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Taiwan Cinema 1949-1999, Hong Kong Cinema 1949-1999, and Mainland Chinese Cinema 1949-1999.
	The text attempts to tackle controversial issues, such as the Japanese influence on cinema during the colonial period, government censorship in Taiwan, anti-communist propaganda films, and the February 28th Incident in 1947 in Taiwan. A comparative line of study connects Taiwan (and Japan during the colonial period), Hong Kong, and mainland China throughout the book. 
Unfortunately, apart from a short bibliography, there is no index for the incredibly rich film related materials, particularly the photographical materials, from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.

Note:	A study of three groups of fictional feature Chinese films from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China focusing on the theme of conflict between love and family relationships.

Both communist films from mainland China and nationalist films from Taiwan accept traditional values such as respect for authority and personal sarifice in order to achieve wider social goals.

Xu, Gary Gang.
Sinascape: contemporary Chinese cinema.
	Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007.		
175 p.
ISBN	9780742554498 (cloth); 9780742554504 (pbk.); 074255449X (cloth : alk. paper); 0742554503 (pbk. : alk. paper)
Note:	Gary Xu’s book Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema	 is primarily a close reading of nine films produced in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  The introduction contains a straightforward presentation of the themes in the text by way of four illustrative vignettes from Xu’s personal experience and research, and an outline of six key topics that the text addresses, including: “1: Proliferation of the copyright industry; 2. Representation of violence and violence of representation; 3 Manipulation of reality through mediation and simulacra; 4. Relentless demolition driven by modernization and urbanization; 5. Erasure of individual memories by linear and masculinist history; and 6. Domination of the socioeconomic and political life by the cinematic mode of production” (20). These themes are organized under the matrix of the term “sinascape,” which Xu prefers over “Chinese-language film.”

Yang, Jeff.
Once upon a time in China: a guide to Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese cinema / Jeff Yang; senior contributor, Art Black, John Charles ….. [et al.]
	New York: Artria books, 2003.	
306 p.
	ISBN	0743448170
Note:	This is a unique and comparative, but Hong Kong-centric, guide to film production in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland. It endeavors to locate common themes between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland Chinese films within each chapter for each time period and explore their “intertwined traditions.” Chapters are as follows:
	Chapter 1: The Dawn of Chinese Film: 1896-1949
	Chapter 2: Swordsmen and Revolutionaries: The Fifties and Sixties
	Chapter 3: Martial Arts and Melodrama: The Seventies
	Chapter 4: New Wave Dreams and Ballistic Kisses: The Eighties
	Chapter 5: The Best of Times, the Worst of Times: The Nineties
	Epilogue: 2000 and Beyond
	All chapters include Capsule Reviews.
	Except for chapter one, which focuses on Mainland China films, all of the following chapters are dominated by Hong Kong films. Attention to Taiwan film is certainly the weakest in the book; for example, there is no mention of Taiwan film production in Chapter 1; and in Chapter 2, while nine Hong Kong film directors and their films are mentioned, only three Taiwan film directors and films are mentioned, and one of them is King Hu whose film career took him from Hong Kong to Taiwan and then back to Hong Kong again. Also note, the text’s method of only using English translations for the titles of all Chinese films could cause confusion. 
	Overall, this text can not be considered a comprehensive guide for films in all three areas, as the main author points out in the preface. 
	Includes Capsule Film Reviews for all chapters, but note that there are some mistakes; for example, the capsule review for Chapter 2 labels two King Hu movies as mainland China productions.

This thesis aims to locate the postion of the Taiwan film industry within the international network of Chinese cinemas in a global age by considering cinema in terms of political economy, commodification, and cultural labor.  Concludes that after joining WTO, China will become the second biggest film market for Hollywood, and that Taiwan’s film industry is losing ground in the areas of marketing, funding, and influence. In order to solve this dilemma, the author advocates for the Taiwan film industry to actively seek co-production opportunities in the global market.

	Series title:	National Cinemas
Note:	A serious academic work that provides thorough research and original perspectives. As the first attempt to outline Chinese film history in English with an up-to-date and “chronological history” study approach, the author uses a “Chinese national cinema” paradigm to cover all films produced in mainland China (including those prior to 1949), Hong Kong and Taiwan, while at the same time instructing the reader to keep in mind all associated problematics and “messiness” -- theoretical as well as geopolitical -- surrounding “China” and “Chineseness”. Th text forms a “general and potentially comparative framework of Chinese national cinema” in the three territories of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Unlike many other works on the same subject, it provides a unique historical perspective: “Cinema and national traditions, 1896-1929”, “Cinema and the nation-people, 1930-49”,  “Cinematic reinvention of the national in Taiwan, 1896-1978”,  “Cinematic revival of the regional in Hong Kong, 1945-78”, “Cinema and the nation-state in the PRC, 1949-78”, “Cinema and national/regional cultures, 1979-89”,  “Cinema and the transnational imaginary, 1990-2002”.  This is not a comprehensive history of Chinese cinema; the author states: “this book concentrates primarily on feature films”.
	Since the publisher does not print Chinese characters, the author reasonably used Pinyin unless names are more commonly recognized in Wade-Giles or Cantonese (for more information regarding this tactic, see the “Romanization and Name spelling” section at the beginning of this volume). Almost all Chinese film titles in the text and index are presented in their English translations, without romanization or Chinese characters.

Note:	This is an unprecedented joint project involving scholars from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China under the auspices of the Chinese Taipei Film Archive. It presents short essays, chronological statements, quoted film reviews, and a prodigious quantity of film stills, posters, and photos to illustrate a century of Chinese cinema history. It is the most objective and comprehensive description of Chinese film history in terms of the photographic materials and range of subjects included in the book, but not in terms of in-depth academic exploration of the topics presented.  
	It is a bilingual work of Chinese and English and is divided into four parts:  Chinese Cinema 1896-1949 (with separate chapters dealing with the beginnings of Chinese cinema in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), Taiwan Cinema 1949-1999, Hong Kong Cinema 1949-1999, and Mainland Chinese Cinema 1949-1999.
	The text attempts to tackle controversial issues, such as the Japanese influence on cinema during the colonial period, government censorship in Taiwan, anti-communist propaganda films, and the February 28th Incident in 1947 in Taiwan. A comparative line of study connects Taiwan (and Japan during the colonial period), Hong Kong, and mainland China throughout the book. 
Unfortunately, apart from a short bibliography, there is no index for the incredibly rich film related materials, particularly the photographical materials, from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China.

Since 1980, the Taiwanese government has implemented a domestic film subsidy system; however, the subsidy policy did not entirely alter Hollywood’s colonization of Taiwan’s domestic film market in which 90% of Taiwan’s box office was taken by Hollywood films, with local Taiwanese films usually contributing less than 1% of the box office. 
This study uses quantitative research, interviews, and the lens of Edward Said’s theory of “Culture and Imperialism” to study the feasibility of a screen quotas system in Taiwan in order to protect Taiwan’s domestic film industry and enable it to prosper.

341 p.
	ISBN	9780520251335 (cloth: alk.paper) 9780520251342 (pbk.: alk.paper)
Note:	Michael Curtin’s text, Playing to the World’s Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV examines the shifting dynamics of film and television industries in an era of global connectivity.  While the historical breadth of the project considers the early filmic entertainment industries in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it focuses on the: “dramatic changes that have occurred since the 1980s with the end of the Cold War, the rise of the World Trade Organization, the modernization policies of the PRC, the end of martial law in Taiwan, the transfer off Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the high-tech liberalization of Singapore, the rise of consumer and youth cultures across the regions, and the growing wealth and influence of overseas Chinese in such cities as Vancouver, London, and Kuala Lumpur” (3). This book focuses on the challenge of globalization during the 1990s and early 2000s, confronts the idea that Hollywood hegemony will last indefinitely, and considers globalized Chinese media enterprises that faced a slower pace of expansion in wake of the financial crisis of 1997 and the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000.  In short, the text discusses how commercial media enterprises -- and at times the text addresses state media in the PRC -- adjusts and shifts to the social and institutional dynamics of the new millennium. Includes a broad historical synopsis of the Shaw Brothers Studio (Chapter 1), a study of Hollywood’s saturation of Taiwan’s film market (Chapter 4), and an account of the current cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan (Chapter 6).

Based on Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores structural changes within the field of film production in Taiwan from 1998-2003 by way of interviewing 12 local Taiwan film directors. Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.

An overview of Taiwan’s film industry as influenced by political and economic changes during the 1990s: local capital was moved to the area of foreign film distribution dominated by Hollywood; in 1999, Taiwan only produced sixteen films and occupied less than 0.46% of the box office income in Taiwan. The paper argues that the government did not adequately change its film policies and even abandoned some valuable cultural regulations which protected the domestic film industry after entering the WTO.

By assessing film-related stories from two Taiwan newspapers, the Chinese Times Daily and United Daily as the case studies, this paper describes responses to, and the presentation of , Hollywood films in Taiwan. In the 1990s, Hollywood films flooded Taiwan’s theaters (in 1996, Hollywood films occupied 90% of Taiwan’s film market), at the same time, the Taiwan government, policy makers, scholars, and film workers tried to alleviate Taiwan’s film market slippage. Research reveals that Taiwan directors were featured in newspapers in terms of their achievements in receiving awards in international film festivals, the government film subsidies received by these directors, and the difficulties inherent to releasing films domestically -- unlike the Hollywood and Hong Kong newspaper reports that focused on film plots and promotional activities. 
The study recommends that newspapers present Taiwan domestic films with similar exposure as provided for Hollywood films.

Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

This paper divides the development and history of Taiwan domestic film distribution and distributors into three periods: “Beginning Period”: 1954-1980, during which Taiwan’s government instituted policies that restricted imported films, including prints and exhibition of foreign films, in order to ensure the growth of the domestic film industry, prevent unbalanced competition, and control access to foreign films in the local market; the “Golden Era”: 1980-1988, when the Taiwan government deregulated portions of its restrictions and protections in response to the MPEA (Motion Pictures Export Association of America)’s requirements to open Taiwan’s local film market, and Taiwanese distributors could import various foreign films; and the “Decline Time” (1989-1999), during which Taiwan removed almost all of its restrictions and Hollywood Majors directly dominated the Taiwan film market, and Taiwan became the tenth largest film market in Hollywood’s global box office ranking.   
The paper suggests that Taiwan’s: government should control the number of imported film prints and screening venues, media should avoid being Hollywood’s advertising tool, research should focus on local audience and consumer behavior in order to improve domestic film production and distribution.

Chinese ecocinema: in the age of environmental challenges / Edited by Sheldon H. Lu and Jiayan Mi.
	Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2009.		
370 p.
	ISBN	9789622090859, 9789622090866
Note:	A significant text that explores concurrent cinematic reflections of, and approaches to, environmental challenges in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Consists of the following parts: Part I. Hydo-Politics: Water, River, and National Trauma, Part II. Eco-Aesthetics, Heteroscape, and Manufactured Landscape, and Part III. Urban Space in Production and Disappearance, and Part IV. Biothics, Non-Anthropocentrism, and Green Sovereignty. In the text’s first chapter, “Framing ambient Unheimlich: Ecoggedon, Ecological Unconscious, and Water Pathology in New Chinese Cinema,” by Jiayan Mi, examines imagery of water in both post-Mao mainland China and post-Miracle Taiwan cinema and claims that “beneath these seemingly ecodystopian films lies New Chinese Ecocinema’s utopiamism of messianic redemption and elevated humanism.” In addition, chapter 6’s essay “Putting Back the Animals: Women-Animal Meme in Contemporary Taiwanese Ecofeminist Imagination,” by Cha-ju Chang, uses an ecofeminist critique of a woman-animal meme to analyze contemporary Taiwanese films and argues that this meme represents the overlapping oppression and exploitation of both women and animals.

Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 1991. An exploration of the rise and fall of Taiwanese-dialect cinema from 1955-1981. Describes the economic conditions and competition of Taiwanese-dialect films, and government film policies. In conclusion, the paper states that the following reasons lead to the eventual downturn of Taiwanese-dialect cinema: 1. Initially local filmmakers in Taiwan started to produce Taiwanese-dialect films due to a weak market of Mandarin films and stimulation of popular Xiamen-dialect films, 2. the quality of early Taiwanese-dialect films was poor and did not improve over time, even after its initial popular period, due to limited resources, 3. Taiwanese-dialect films inevitably lost their share of the market share when the Mandarin film industry emerged and Japanese films were banned, 4. government film policy and officials in Taiwan were always hostile to Taiwanese-dialect films and film-making. Includes Chinese Abstract, Bibliography, Chronology of Domestic Political Affairs, Film Policies and Government-owned Film Studios, Charts of Mandarin Film-Making and Taiwanese-Dialect Filmmaking, Filmography of Mandarin Films 1949-1954, Taiwanese Theatrical Professionals Involved in Taiwanese-dialect Filmmaking, Lists of Taiwanese-dialect and Mandarin Films Selected and Received Golden Horse Awards, Production Charts of Mandarin and Taiwanese-dialect Films from 1955-1974, and Box Office Record of 1965.

Based on Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores structural changes within the field of film production in Taiwan from 1998-2003 by way of interviewing 12 local Taiwan film directors. Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.

By interviewing three film music composers who represent different periods in Taiwan film history, and using their work as examples, the author explores interesting historical corrolates between Taiwan’s film music and government policies. For example, 1970s film music contained messages of anti-communism and resistance against Japan, while in the 1990s aboriginal and folk music was included in film soundtracks.

An overview of Taiwan’s film industry as influenced by political and economic changes during the 1990s: local capital was moved to the area of foreign film distribution dominated by Hollywood; in 1999, Taiwan only produced sixteen films and occupied less than 0.46% of the box office income in Taiwan. The paper argues that the government did not adequately change its film policies and even abandoned some valuable cultural regulations which protected the domestic film industry after entering the WTO.

Chinese ecocinema: in the age of environmental challenges / Edited by Sheldon H. Lu and Jiayan Mi.
	Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2009.		
370 p.
	ISBN	9789622090859, 9789622090866
Note:	A significant text that explores concurrent cinematic reflections of, and approaches to, environmental challenges in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Consists of the following parts: Part I. Hydo-Politics: Water, River, and National Trauma, Part II. Eco-Aesthetics, Heteroscape, and Manufactured Landscape, and Part III. Urban Space in Production and Disappearance, and Part IV. Biothics, Non-Anthropocentrism, and Green Sovereignty. In the text’s first chapter, “Framing ambient Unheimlich: Ecoggedon, Ecological Unconscious, and Water Pathology in New Chinese Cinema,” by Jiayan Mi, examines imagery of water in both post-Mao mainland China and post-Miracle Taiwan cinema and claims that “beneath these seemingly ecodystopian films lies New Chinese Ecocinema’s utopiamism of messianic redemption and elevated humanism.” In addition, chapter 6’s essay “Putting Back the Animals: Women-Animal Meme in Contemporary Taiwanese Ecofeminist Imagination,” by Cha-ju Chang, uses an ecofeminist critique of a woman-animal meme to analyze contemporary Taiwanese films and argues that this meme represents the overlapping oppression and exploitation of both women and animals.

Note:	A comprehensive work on Chinese martial arts film history. Divides the development of Chinese martial arts films into five periods: 1) the first period in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s, 2) a shift to Hong Kong in the 1940s and 1950s, 3) Hong Kong, and later in Taiwan, in the 1960s and 1970s, 4) a cooperative period between Hong Kong and mainland China in the 1980s and 1990s, and 5) the trend towards globalization and further cooperation between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, using Ang Lee’s film Crouching tiger, hidden dragon (2000) as an example. 
	In the postscript, the author admits that his knowledge of Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts films, specifically during the mid-1960s to the early- 1980s period, is limited and thus apologizes for any missing or over- simplified parts during this section of the book.

Explores the new model of international film production in Taiwan used by Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia (CPFPA) to produce and release the mystery thriller Double Vision (2002), which was successful at the box office in Taiwan after CPFPA had already been successful with its product Crouching tiger, hidden dragon. This model represents a trend of cultural globalization and commodification in Taiwan film production. Appling the discourse of the New International Division of Cultural Labor (NIDCL) and the Global Film Market System in the case of Double Vision, the close connection between transnational film production and characteristics of Hollywood film production is evident. Concludes that the existence of high quality international film co-productions brings major challenges to Taiwan film production in the 21st century due to their emphasis on commercial success rather than cultural representation.  
Includes Chinese & English abstract, Bibliography, and Structure Charts of the globalization of Taiwan film production and information on four films by CPFPA since 2000.

The paper focuses on three of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: A City of Sadness (1989), The Puppetmaster (1993), and Good Men, Good Women (1995), which comprise a historical trilogy covering twentieth century Taiwan history and also are included among the “new wave” Chinese cinematic movements represented by film directors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. The author emphasizes the uniqueness of Hou and his films, which redefine the meaning of national cinema with the environment of globalization, nativism, state-sponsored cultural identity, and regionally differentiated identity.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 2006.
Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

Note:	Gary Xu’s book Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema	 is primarily a close reading of nine films produced in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  The introduction contains a straightforward presentation of the themes in the text by way of four illustrative vignettes from Xu’s personal experience and research, and an outline of six key topics that the text addresses, including: “1: Proliferation of the copyright industry; 2. Representation of violence and violence of representation; 3 Manipulation of reality through mediation and simulacra; 4. Relentless demolition driven by modernization and urbanization; 5. Erasure of individual memories by linear and masculinist history; and 6. Domination of the socioeconomic and political life by the cinematic mode of production” (20). These themes are organized under the matrix of the term “sinascape,” which Xu prefers over “Chinese-language film.”

Note:	A rare, early English work on Taiwan and Hong Kong films screened in Taiwan during the 1960s. The text focuses on the relationship between film and Chinese society, folktales, legends, myth, opera, novels, and short-stories. The introduction’s subtitle is: “Family and Social Problems in Chinese Films Shown in Taiwan.” Includes abstracts of 329 films (pp. 41-223); film titles, presented in both Wade-Giles and Chinese characters, are followed by a synopsis and a note regarding screening locations and dates. Rather than using page numbers, the book’s general index references the text’s 329 film abstracts by their respective, sequentially assigned numbers. The quality of the book’s paper, printing, editing, translation and organization is very poor.

Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

By assessing film-related stories from two Taiwan newspapers, the Chinese Times Daily and United Daily as the case studies, this paper describes responses to, and the presentation of , Hollywood films in Taiwan. In the 1990s, Hollywood films flooded Taiwan’s theaters (in 1996, Hollywood films occupied 90% of Taiwan’s film market), at the same time, the Taiwan government, policy makers, scholars, and film workers tried to alleviate Taiwan’s film market slippage. Research reveals that Taiwan directors were featured in newspapers in terms of their achievements in receiving awards in international film festivals, the government film subsidies received by these directors, and the difficulties inherent to releasing films domestically -- unlike the Hollywood and Hong Kong newspaper reports that focused on film plots and promotional activities. 
The study recommends that newspapers present Taiwan domestic films with similar exposure as provided for Hollywood films.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Central University, 2001.
The paper studies how Taiwan’s film industry was managed during the political struggle between Taiwan Governor Chen Yi and the KMT CC Clique after retrocession from 1945-1949. The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.

Asserts that Hou Hsiao-hsien’s unconventional style in his film A City of Sadness (1989) should be examined carefully, for the director’s representation of history reveals an indirect cinematic, but not an evasive, approach to the historical reality. This position is voiced in contradition to critics who claim Hou's representation of the 2/28 Incident keeps a safe distance from the sensitive events and conforms to the KMT government's perspective. It is written in English.

Based on Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores structural changes within the field of film production in Taiwan from 1998-2003 by way of interviewing 12 local Taiwan film directors. Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.

An overview of Taiwan’s film industry as influenced by political and economic changes during the 1990s: local capital was moved to the area of foreign film distribution dominated by Hollywood; in 1999, Taiwan only produced sixteen films and occupied less than 0.46% of the box office income in Taiwan. The paper argues that the government did not adequately change its film policies and even abandoned some valuable cultural regulations which protected the domestic film industry after entering the WTO.

The paper focuses on three of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: A City of Sadness (1989), The Puppetmaster (1993), and Good Men, Good Women (1995), which comprise a historical trilogy covering twentieth century Taiwan history and also are included among the “new wave” Chinese cinematic movements represented by film directors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. The author emphasizes the uniqueness of Hou and his films, which redefine the meaning of national cinema with the environment of globalization, nativism, state-sponsored cultural identity, and regionally differentiated identity.

The paper analyzes the discursive formation of Taiwan’s Healthy Realism movement in the 1960s. The author argues that, based on an understanding of the historical milieu, including KMT film and cultural policy practiced since the 1930s and widespread government censorship in Taiwan during the 1960s, while at the same time filmmakers used subtle tactics in their struggle for artistic freedom and film critics and film historians desired relevant film productions while preserving the KMT’s monolithic governance, Healthy Realism emerged as a landmark achievement, exerting a powerful influence on popular memory and social integration.

Both communist films from mainland China and nationalist films from Taiwan accept traditional values such as respect for authority and personal sarifice in order to achieve wider social goals.

Note:	An unpublished official report commissioned by Council for Cultural Affairs, Executive Yuan, and prepared by the Chinese Taipei Film Archive (Oct. 1, 2000-May 31, 2001).

The purpose of the report is to confirm the necessity of  the Council for Cultural Affairs to supervise film, suggest the establishment of the National Film Cultural Center with a plan and implementation methods, discover and clarify the problems faced by Taiwan’s film industry and provide a viable solution, and adopt related film and cultural policies and regulations as well as industry supportive measures developed by other countries in the world.

Yeh, Yueh-yu.
A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

Note: 	As the author states in the preface, this work focuses its attention on film policy issues in Taiwan from 1949-1967. The book provides suggestions to the government regarding the establishment of complete and reasonable film laws and policies that would enable the best possible environment for the development of Taiwan's film industry. For example, the author recommends controlling the importation and distribution of foreign films in Taiwan due to the threat of American film distribution in Taiwan.  Suggestions are also made regarding Taiwan's filmmaking personnel by offering a comparative study of Japanese and Taiwan film development after WWII. The Appendix includes some important statistics, such as a filmography of Taiwan films produced from 1948-1967 (pp. 77-87), the annual ten best Mandarin films at the box office from 1957-1967 (pp. 78-96), and a statistical record of movie theatre attendance in the Taiwan area in 1967 (pp. 97-98).

	ISBN	9780520251335 (cloth: alk.paper) 9780520251342 (pbk.: alk.paper)
Note:	Michael Curtin’s text, Playing to the World’s Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV examines the shifting dynamics of film and television industries in an era of global connectivity.  While the historical breadth of the project considers the early filmic entertainment industries in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it focuses on the: “dramatic changes that have occurred since the 1980s with the end of the Cold War, the rise of the World Trade Organization, the modernization policies of the PRC, the end of martial law in Taiwan, the transfer off Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the high-tech liberalization of Singapore, the rise of consumer and youth cultures across the regions, and the growing wealth and influence of overseas Chinese in such cities as Vancouver, London, and Kuala Lumpur” (3). This book focuses on the challenge of globalization during the 1990s and early 2000s, confronts the idea that Hollywood hegemony will last indefinitely, and considers globalized Chinese media enterprises that faced a slower pace of expansion in wake of the financial crisis of 1997 and the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000.  In short, the text discusses how commercial media enterprises -- and at times the text addresses state media in the PRC -- adjusts and shifts to the social and institutional dynamics of the new millennium. Includes a broad historical synopsis of the Shaw Brothers Studio (Chapter 1), a study of Hollywood’s saturation of Taiwan’s film market (Chapter 4), and an account of the current cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan (Chapter 6).

Based on Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores structural changes within the field of film production in Taiwan from 1998-2003 by way of interviewing 12 local Taiwan film directors. Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.

The paper recommends that the government: clearly identify its position in relation to the cultural nature of Taiwan’s film industry, create a single and united department in charge of planning and managing film related affairs, and employ a contract-based recruiting system for hiring the archive’s film professionals.

271 p.

“This study is a tribute to Taiwan New Cinema and the films that came after”; focuses on three major film directors of Taiwan New Cinema: Edward Yang, Chang Yi, and Hou Hsiao-hsien, as well as a cultural figure  and film director since the 1990s: Stan Lai. The “foreign/er” is used as a framework and metaphor that facilitates the permutation of the varied and complex meanings of Taiwan New Cinema. Assesses how Taipei is the “city foreigner” in Edward Yang’s films, Lan Shengchun’s films explore the “mainlander-foreigner” dynamic, three films made by Chang Yi and his partner Yang Huishan present Yang’s body as a space where foreign and familiar forces become intertwined, and, as the most daring experimenter, Hou Hsiao-hsien pursues a very foreign form to present Taiwan stories in his films.

370 p.
	ISBN	9789622090859, 9789622090866
Note:	A significant text that explores concurrent cinematic reflections of, and approaches to, environmental challenges in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Consists of the following parts: Part I. Hydo-Politics: Water, River, and National Trauma, Part II. Eco-Aesthetics, Heteroscape, and Manufactured Landscape, and Part III. Urban Space in Production and Disappearance, and Part IV. Biothics, Non-Anthropocentrism, and Green Sovereignty. In the text’s first chapter, “Framing ambient Unheimlich: Ecoggedon, Ecological Unconscious, and Water Pathology in New Chinese Cinema,” by Jiayan Mi, examines imagery of water in both post-Mao mainland China and post-Miracle Taiwan cinema and claims that “beneath these seemingly ecodystopian films lies New Chinese Ecocinema’s utopiamism of messianic redemption and elevated humanism.” In addition, chapter 6’s essay “Putting Back the Animals: Women-Animal Meme in Contemporary Taiwanese Ecofeminist Imagination,” by Cha-ju Chang, uses an ecofeminist critique of a woman-animal meme to analyze contemporary Taiwanese films and argues that this meme represents the overlapping oppression and exploitation of both women and animals.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Taiwan University, 2006.
Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

This position is voiced in contradition to critics who claim Hou's representation of the 2/28 Incident keeps a safe distance from the sensitive events and conforms to the KMT government's perspective.

Inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s notion of the time-image, the paper re-defines the three signature styles of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: Nostalgia, Slowness, and Realism through a new concept: “Train-image”. The train is not simply regarded as a diegetic symbol in his films, but instead a metaphor combining train-traveling and film-viewing experience to recapitulate the aesthetics of Hou’s films.

The paper focuses on three of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s films: A City of Sadness (1989), The Puppetmaster (1993), and Good Men, Good Women (1995), which comprise a historical trilogy covering twentieth century Taiwan history and also are included among the “new wave” Chinese cinematic movements represented by film directors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. The author emphasizes the uniqueness of Hou and his films, which redefine the meaning of national cinema with the environment of globalization, nativism, state-sponsored cultural identity, and regionally differentiated identity.

271 p.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – Cornell University, 1995.
“This study is a tribute to Taiwan New Cinema and the films that came after”; focuses on three major film directors of Taiwan New Cinema: Edward Yang, Chang Yi, and Hou Hsiao-hsien, as well as a cultural figure  and film director since the 1990s: Stan Lai. The “foreign/er” is used as a framework and metaphor that facilitates the permutation of the varied and complex meanings of Taiwan New Cinema. Assesses how Taipei is the “city foreigner” in Edward Yang’s films, Lan Shengchun’s films explore the “mainlander-foreigner” dynamic, three films made by Chang Yi and his partner Yang Huishan present Yang’s body as a space where foreign and familiar forces become intertwined, and, as the most daring experimenter, Hou Hsiao-hsien pursues a very foreign form to present Taiwan stories in his films.

Permutations of the foriegn/er: a study of the works of Edward Yang, Stan Lai, Chang Yi, and Hou Hisao-Hsien.
271 p.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – Cornell University, 1995.
“This study is a tribute to Taiwan New Cinema and the films that came after”; focuses on three major film directors of Taiwan New Cinema: Edward Yang, Chang Yi, and Hou Hsiao-hsien, as well as a cultural figure  and film director since the 1990s: Stan Lai. The “foreign/er” is used as a framework and metaphor that facilitates the permutation of the varied and complex meanings of Taiwan New Cinema. Assesses how Taipei is the “city foreigner” in Edward Yang’s films, Lan Shengchun’s films explore the “mainlander-foreigner” dynamic, three films made by Chang Yi and his partner Yang Huishan present Yang’s body as a space where foreign and familiar forces become intertwined, and, as the most daring experimenter, Hou Hsiao-hsien pursues a very foreign form to present Taiwan stories in his films.

Taiwan dian ying xi ju shi = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
台灣電影戲劇史 = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
	Taibei: Yin hua chu ban she, 1961.	
577 p.
Note:	This is the earliest known academic work on Taiwan film and opera/drama history written by a Taiwanese scholar. The first part of the book, Taiwan Film History (pp. 1-156), contains Chapter 1: Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period, Chapter 2: Taiwan Film after retrocession, Chapter 3: International cooperation in film production, Chapter 4: Introduction of Taiwan film studios, Chapter 5: Official film advisory and censorship functions, Chapter 6: Non-governmental film organizations, Chapter 7: Film education and workshops, Chapter 8: Film related publications, Chapter 9: Film theory and critics, and Chapter 10: Film industry and theatres. 
   	As a groundbreaking work, the author provides a vast amount of firsthand information about Taiwan Film History from 1901-1961, including dates, names, and events related to the Taiwan film. However, as an academic work, it is weak in terms of theoretical analysis and objectivity due to the limits of the overall political and academic environment during the time. 
Moreover, in 1992, Lee Daw-ming, a Taiwan scholar, found out that Lu had copied part of chapter 3 from Japanese scholar Sai Ichigawa’s work: Ajia eiga no sōzō oyobi kensetsu (Creation and Building of Asian Films) in Chapter 1: “Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period” within the Taiwan Film History part of his work. Li’s discovery was published in the article: “Dian ying shi ru he lai dao Taiwan de” (How did film come to Taiwan), in Dian ying xin shang (Film Appreciation), No. 9/10, (Sept. /Oct., 1993) p. 107.
The preface includes an introduction of the author written by You Mijian.
Appendix includes the author’s photo collection (pp. 536-542), an essay on Taiwanese-dialect film (pp. 543-544), and the author’s resume (pp. 576).

The “foreign/er” is used as a framework and metaphor that facilitates the permutation of the varied and complex meanings of Taiwan New Cinema. Assesses how Taipei is the “city foreigner” in Edward Yang’s films, Lan Shengchun’s films explore the “mainlander-foreigner” dynamic, three films made by Chang Yi and his partner Yang Huishan present Yang’s body as a space where foreign and familiar forces become intertwined, and, as the most daring experimenter, Hou Hsiao-hsien pursues a very foreign form to present Taiwan stories in his films.

Interestingly, Taiwan film actress Jiang Qing (1946- ) is included in the book; however, the mainland China film actress Jiang Qing (1914-1991) is not included in the book because, as Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong’s wife, her later political involvement led the editor to decide not to include her in the book. Includes a name index based on the number of Chinese character strokes in each name, a name index based on Pinyin names in alphabetical order at the beginning of the book, two lists of mainland China and Taiwan film actors and actresses who won awards abroad, and three lists of film actors and actresses who won any of the three domestic film awards in both mainland China and Taiwan.

	Taipei: Zhonghua ying ping ren xie hui, 2004.	
2 v.
Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

Taiwan dian ying xi ju shi = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
台灣電影戲劇史 = A history of cinema and drama in Taiwan.
	Taibei: Yin hua chu ban she, 1961.	
577 p.
Note:	This is the earliest known academic work on Taiwan film and opera/drama history written by a Taiwanese scholar. The first part of the book, Taiwan Film History (pp. 1-156), contains Chapter 1: Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period, Chapter 2: Taiwan Film after retrocession, Chapter 3: International cooperation in film production, Chapter 4: Introduction of Taiwan film studios, Chapter 5: Official film advisory and censorship functions, Chapter 6: Non-governmental film organizations, Chapter 7: Film education and workshops, Chapter 8: Film related publications, Chapter 9: Film theory and critics, and Chapter 10: Film industry and theatres. 
   	As a groundbreaking work, the author provides a vast amount of firsthand information about Taiwan Film History from 1901-1961, including dates, names, and events related to the Taiwan film. However, as an academic work, it is weak in terms of theoretical analysis and objectivity due to the limits of the overall political and academic environment during the time. 
Moreover, in 1992, Lee Daw-ming, a Taiwan scholar, found out that Lu had copied part of chapter 3 from Japanese scholar Sai Ichigawa’s work: Ajia eiga no sōzō oyobi kensetsu (Creation and Building of Asian Films) in Chapter 1: “Taiwan film during the Japanese occupation period” within the Taiwan Film History part of his work. Li’s discovery was published in the article: “Dian ying shi ru he lai dao Taiwan de” (How did film come to Taiwan), in Dian ying xin shang (Film Appreciation), No. 9/10, (Sept. /Oct., 1993) p. 107.
The preface includes an introduction of the author written by You Mijian.
Appendix includes the author’s photo collection (pp. 536-542), an essay on Taiwanese-dialect film (pp. 543-544), and the author’s resume (pp. 576).

Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

Hou Hsiao-Hsien and Tsai Ming-Liang’s films have been warmly received by the French public; however, films directed by Taiwan film directors of the early 2000s have not fared as well. The paper provides interviews with French film distributors and points out that “observations of Taiwan distributors and the Taipei Film Commission at Le Marché du Film de Cannes revealed a lack of effort to attract French or European buyers.” In addition, “Taiwan, and Asian Cinema in general, is facing a great opponent as French distributors are now being attracted to more emergent cinemas coming from South America and Africa. Furthermore, interviews with French distributors shows that the type of films French distributors are more likely to buy is an art house type of cinema as opposed to the rather commercial type of cinema that regained Taiwanese audience attention since 2008”, including Cape No.7, a hugely successful film in Taiwan’s domestic market.

	Note:	Thesis (Master) – Yuan Ze University, 2000.
This paper divides the development and history of Taiwan domestic film distribution and distributors into three periods: “Beginning Period”: 1954-1980, during which Taiwan’s government instituted policies that restricted imported films, including prints and exhibition of foreign films, in order to ensure the growth of the domestic film industry, prevent unbalanced competition, and control access to foreign films in the local market; the “Golden Era”: 1980-1988, when the Taiwan government deregulated portions of its restrictions and protections in response to the MPEA (Motion Pictures Export Association of America)’s requirements to open Taiwan’s local film market, and Taiwanese distributors could import various foreign films; and the “Decline Time” (1989-1999), during which Taiwan removed almost all of its restrictions and Hollywood Majors directly dominated the Taiwan film market, and Taiwan became the tenth largest film market in Hollywood’s global box office ranking.   
The paper suggests that Taiwan’s: government should control the number of imported film prints and screening venues, media should avoid being Hollywood’s advertising tool, research should focus on local audience and consumer behavior in order to improve domestic film production and distribution.

Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

Analyzes the filmic relationship between international recognition and success at the Taiwan box office. Notes that The City of Sadness achieved both international recognition (won the Golden Lion Award at the International Venice Film Festival) and success at the Taiwan box office, as did two of Ang Lee’s films which won Oscars and attracted Taiwan audiences. Yet The City of Sadness was an anomaly, and Ang Lee’s films had good stories; instead, most Taiwan films that garnered international acclaim do not perform well in Taiwan. Thus, the author recommends that Taiwan’s government should not only encourage winning international film festival competitions, but should also encourage the development of interesting narrative content for the Taiwan film market.

	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Central University, 2001.
The paper studies how Taiwan’s film industry was managed during the political struggle between Taiwan Governor Chen Yi and the KMT CC Clique after retrocession from 1945-1949. The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.

Curtin, Michael.
Playing to the world’s biggest audience: the globalization of Chinese film and TV.
Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2007. 
341 p.
	ISBN	9780520251335 (cloth: alk.paper) 9780520251342 (pbk.: alk.paper)
Note:	Michael Curtin’s text, Playing to the World’s Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV examines the shifting dynamics of film and television industries in an era of global connectivity.  While the historical breadth of the project considers the early filmic entertainment industries in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, it focuses on the: “dramatic changes that have occurred since the 1980s with the end of the Cold War, the rise of the World Trade Organization, the modernization policies of the PRC, the end of martial law in Taiwan, the transfer off Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the high-tech liberalization of Singapore, the rise of consumer and youth cultures across the regions, and the growing wealth and influence of overseas Chinese in such cities as Vancouver, London, and Kuala Lumpur” (3). This book focuses on the challenge of globalization during the 1990s and early 2000s, confronts the idea that Hollywood hegemony will last indefinitely, and considers globalized Chinese media enterprises that faced a slower pace of expansion in wake of the financial crisis of 1997 and the burst of the dotcom bubble in 2000.  In short, the text discusses how commercial media enterprises -- and at times the text addresses state media in the PRC -- adjusts and shifts to the social and institutional dynamics of the new millennium. Includes a broad historical synopsis of the Shaw Brothers Studio (Chapter 1), a study of Hollywood’s saturation of Taiwan’s film market (Chapter 4), and an account of the current cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan (Chapter 6). 
Includes Industry Interviews, Notes, Bibliography, and Index.

Note:	A comprehensive and objective text on Taiwan film history. Significant achievements of the work include: 1) discovery that the first film shown in Taiwan occurred in 1899, differing from scholars who claim the first screening occurred in 1901, 2) a detailed description of Taiwan film artists’ activities and achievements during the colonial period in both Taiwan and mainland China, 3) covers Taiwan film history from multiple perspectives, 4) the authors maintain an objective stance while approaching politically charged issues such as the Japanese influence on Taiwan cinema, propaganda films in Taiwan, the Nationalist Government’s censorship system, and 5), the text includes important filmographies in some of its chapters. Shortcomings of the work include: 1) poor editing: multiple typos, such as on page 19, when the date of the first feature film made in Taiwan, by the Japanese, is written as 1902 instead of 1922, and chapter 12 starts on p. 331, but in the table of contents it starts on p. 329, 2) poor content organization, for example, chapters 11-21 in volume 2 are not connected cohesively, 3) the text does not contain a complete bibliography, filmography, or indexes, except for inconsistent bibliographical materials included at the end of selected chapters. Thus, it is difficult to recommend this text as reference material, even though it contains important historical information.

An overview of Taiwan’s film industry as influenced by political and economic changes during the 1990s: local capital was moved to the area of foreign film distribution dominated by Hollywood; in 1999, Taiwan only produced sixteen films and occupied less than 0.46% of the box office income in Taiwan. The paper argues that the government did not adequately change its film policies and even abandoned some valuable cultural regulations which protected the domestic film industry after entering the WTO.

Slide, Anthony.
The international film industry: a historical dictionary.
	New York: Greenwood press, 1989.	
423 p.
	ISBN	0313256357
Note: 	As a dictionary for the international film industry, this text has limited and often biased information about the Chinese film industry. For example, under the “Taiwan” entry (pp 345-346), the influence of Japan during the colonial period (1895-1945) is not mentioned, while the explanation that Taiwan’s film industry originated in mainland China is, at the least, incomplete. However, the text does provide interesting statistics and factors of the overall picture of Taiwan film industry. For example: at the time of the book's publication there were 450 movie theatres in Taiwan and the cost of producing a film in Taiwan was $100,000, the output of Taiwan’s annual feature films decreased from 250 at the beginning of the 1980s to 150 by the end of the 1980s; also, after Japan severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in the mid-1970s, Japanese films were banned in Taiwan. Includes an index at the end of the book and a bibliography under each entry.

The paper studies how Taiwan’s film industry was managed during the political struggle between Taiwan Governor Chen Yi and the KMT CC Clique after retrocession from 1945-1949. The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.

Since 1980, the Taiwanese government has implemented a domestic film subsidy system; however, the subsidy policy did not entirely alter Hollywood’s colonization of Taiwan’s domestic film market in which 90% of Taiwan’s box office was taken by Hollywood films, with local Taiwanese films usually contributing less than 1% of the box office. 
This study uses quantitative research, interviews, and the lens of Edward Said’s theory of “Culture and Imperialism” to study the feasibility of a screen quotas system in Taiwan in order to protect Taiwan’s domestic film industry and enable it to prosper.

Considering that globalization and Hollywood domination has greatly influenced Chinese film-making, the paper selects three major Chinese film directors and compares their works before and after receiving transnational and Hollywood investment, including: Ang Lee’s Wedding Banquet (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Hero (2002), and Chen Kaige’s Farewell my Concubine (1993) and The Promise (2005). Concludes that the influence of globalization is inevitable, and the pressure of box office success challenges the directors’ integrity and cultural and national values. In terms of Taiwan’s film industry, the paper suggests that the government should change its policy: subsidies need to be more carefully directed to promsing directors and their works and their subjects should not be limited to “local characteristics”.

The paper analyzes the discursive formation of Taiwan’s Healthy Realism movement in the 1960s. The author argues that, based on an understanding of the historical milieu, including KMT film and cultural policy practiced since the 1930s and widespread government censorship in Taiwan during the 1960s, while at the same time filmmakers used subtle tactics in their struggle for artistic freedom and film critics and film historians desired relevant film productions while preserving the KMT’s monolithic governance, Healthy Realism emerged as a landmark achievement, exerting a powerful influence on popular memory and social integration.

Hou Hsiao-Hsien and Tsai Ming-Liang’s films have been warmly received by the French public; however, films directed by Taiwan film directors of the early 2000s have not fared as well. The paper provides interviews with French film distributors and points out that “observations of Taiwan distributors and the Taipei Film Commission at Le Marché du Film de Cannes revealed a lack of effort to attract French or European buyers.” In addition, “Taiwan, and Asian Cinema in general, is facing a great opponent as French distributors are now being attracted to more emergent cinemas coming from South America and Africa. Furthermore, interviews are more likely to buy is an art house type of cinema as opposed to the rather commercial type of cinema that regained Taiwanese audience attention since 2008”, including Cape No.7, a hugely successful film in Taiwan’s domestic market.

Analyzes the filmic relationship between international recognition and success at the Taiwan box office. Notes that The City of Sadness achieved both international recognition (won the Golden Lion Award at the International Venice Film Festival) and success at the Taiwan box office, as did two of Ang Lee’s films which won Oscars and attracted Taiwan audiences. Yet The City of Sadness was an anomaly, and Ang Lee’s films had good stories; instead, most Taiwan films that garnered international acclaim do not perform well in Taiwan. Thus, the author recommends that Taiwan’s government should not only encourage winning international film festival competitions, but should also encourage the development of interesting narrative content for the Taiwan film market.

This study uses a “quantile regression” model in order to determine factors that influence the box office of Hollywood films. Observations based on the results include the following: a particular film’s budget does necessarily have a positive influce on the said film’s total box-office, and the correlation between earnings during the first week at the box-office and the film’s American audience population is significantly related to both high quantile box-office earnings and a positive influence on high quantile potential in terms of market demand. This thesis also proposes marketing concepts and future research directions for the Taiwan film market.

A national score: popular music and Taiwanese cinema.
263 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Southern California, 1995.
An interesting study on the relationship between popular music, cinema, and national identity in Taiwan from the 1970s to the 1990s. Explores multiple relevant interrelationships between popular music and Taiwan cinema, including the inclusion of popular songs in 1970’s policy films and romantic melodramas, the exclusion of pop music in Taiwan New Cinema in the 1980s, and the return of popular music in commercial films of the 1990s, thus revealing “a national identity characterized by shifting loci of commerce, politics, and art.” 
As a serious academic work, it provides many interesting perspectives based on in-depth research and substantial evidence. However, it states: “A huge massacre occurred in 1945 when many Taiwanese rose up against the semi-colonial governance of the National Party.” (p. 2), which is possibly miswritten, for if Dr. Yeh is referring to the 2/28 Incident, this event occurred in 1947. In addition, it is surprising that when the author discusses Hou Hsiao-hsien and his usage of music in the chapter entitled: “The case of Hou Hsiao-hsien” (leaves. 164-170), one of Hou’s most famous films, City of Sadness (1989), goes unmentioned.

	250 leaves.
	Note:	Thesis (M.A.) – National Central University, 2001.
The paper studies how Taiwan’s film industry was managed during the political struggle between Taiwan Governor Chen Yi and the KMT CC Clique after retrocession from 1945-1949. The author points out that Chen Yi’s aim was to manage the film industry with a profit-oriented, loss-control policy, in contrast to the CC Clique's intention to manage the film industry with absolute control, using film as an arm of the government’s propaganda, education, and ideological machinery. Thus, it is apparent that Taiwan’s film industry developed from the beginning as a site of political struggle, dependent on government policy. Consists of five chapters: Chapter 1: Government’s Attitude towards Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 2: Process of Appropriating the Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 3:  Factional Struggle in Taiwan Film Industry, Chapter 4: Management and Censorship in Film Industry, and Chapter 5: Profit and Propaganda of Film Industry.

	Note:	Thesis (Master) – Shi Hsin University, 2009.
Since 1980, the Taiwanese government has implemented a domestic film subsidy system; however, the subsidy policy did not entirely alter Hollywood’s colonization of Taiwan’s domestic film market in which 90% of Taiwan’s box office was taken by Hollywood films, with local Taiwanese films usually contributing less than 1% of the box office. 
This study uses quantitative research, interviews, and the lens of Edward Said’s theory of “Culture and Imperialism” to study the feasibility of a screen quotas system in Taiwan in order to protect Taiwan’s domestic film industry and enable it to prosper.

Based on Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores structural changes within the field of film production in Taiwan from 1998-2003 by way of interviewing 12 local Taiwan film directors. Politically, Taiwan’s film industry inherits a legacy of censorship and propaganda; economically, Hollywood films dominate Taiwan’s market after limits on imported foreign films were lifted. As the result of these conditions, and various solutions proposed by film directors, the paper suggests that the government intervene by being more involved in film production and establishing improved film policies.

Since 1980, the Taiwanese government has implemented a domestic film subsidy system; however, the subsidy policy did not entirely alter Hollywood’s colonization of Taiwan’s domestic film market in which 90% of Taiwan’s box office was taken by Hollywood films, with local Taiwanese films usually contributing less than 1% of the box office. 
This study uses quantitative research, interviews, and the lens of Edward Said’s theory of “Culture and Imperialism” to study the feasibility of a screen quotas system in Taiwan in order to protect Taiwan’s domestic film industry and enable it to prosper.
