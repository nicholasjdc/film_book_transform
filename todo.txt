Final to-dos:
    - delete duplicate entries
    - Manually upload final entry
    - Ask dad about how to number new combined entries
    - Also ask dad about weird duplicate entries (1661 or 1691 i think?)
    - maybe expand if fun







x    0130 -- weird publication
x 0515 -- author is only a single word, no comma,

 Main issues:
 - Author can be single word, or "[word] , [word] ..."
- single word author
- author no comma
- author too long
- page count, no pagination
- Page number being caught in publication
- page number before publication, consuming publication

JSON issue:
- need to add a comma between entries
- would like to title the entries w/ the entrynumber
Code implementation:
    - Consistent elements: 
    (Entry Number -- always a 4 digit number) 
    [Variable containing author, title] 
    (publication -- Has two words[sometimes with comma after first word], then colon) 
    (page/volume numbers -- ends w/ p. or v.)
    (ISBN -- always starts with "ISBN")
    (Note -- can be mulitple lines)
    (Language Codes -- Chi, Eng, WorldCat, etc. If next line is blank, then we are at language codes)

    - Meta elements:
    First entry is always entry number
    [Author ?]
        -- If entry is "word, word" or the entry is under 3 words, the entry is author
        -- else if the entry is the title
        -- the following line can also be the author in chinese 
    [Title]
        -- Separate by slash
            - words after the slash are the authors
        -- separate by equals sign 
            - Each side of the equals sign are the title in different languages (detect language)
        -- the following line can also be the title in chinese
    Title
    publication begins with 1-2 words then a colon
    End entry with empty line
